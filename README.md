This repo contains the source codes for the final project of Convex Optimization (14:332:509): **Evaluating SGD Variants on Large-scale Machine Learning Problems**.

In this project, different variants of SGD optimizers were used on large-scale machine learning problems:

- Image Classification on MNIST Dataset
- Semantic Segmentation on the Kaggle Carvana Dataset
- Sentiment Analysis on the SST-5 Dataset
- Linear Regression on the California Housing Dataset

The optimizers that were used were the following:

- Basic SGD: SGD
- Variance-Reducing SGD: SVRG
- Accelerate SGD: NAG
- Adaptive Learning Rate SGD: Adam, RMSprop, Adadelta, Ranger, Prodigy
- Proximal SGD: ProxSG
