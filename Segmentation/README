Create a Kaggle account and download the Carvana dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge

Download the train.zip and train_masks.zip files only, create a new folder called Images in this directory, and then drag all the ground truth images (JPGs) and ground truth masks (GIFs) into this folder.  Run the generateDataset program to split the data into training, validation, and testing dataloaders.

Code adapted from: https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/master/ML/Pytorch/image_segmentation/semantic_segmentation_unet

Trained with torch version 2.2.2, CUDA version 12.4. Install missing modules as needed.
