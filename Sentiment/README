To run this code, you must download glove.840B.300d.txt from the following link: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ and put it in the directory of this folder.

DGL must also be installed which only works up until torch version 2.2.1 at the moment: https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/

It is recommended to create a conda environment with Python version torch version 2.2.1, CUDA version 12.1.1, and dgl version 2.1.0 if you want to train with CUDA.  Please see the included conda config file (req.txt) for help.
